I was recently talking about my TW coding excercise and checked and 
found it in my emails. So I'm sharing it for posterity. I hope TW 
doesn't still send out DMCA takedown notices for these. ;p

(I added this README, .gitignore and had to bump the compiler version
from 1.6 to 1.7 in the pom. Otherwise this is unchanged.)

From my original email when I sent this in on 28.03.2011:

salestaxes.Main is the main entry-point to the application. It tries
to parse a given input string to create Items to add to a
ShoppingCart. The cart is then printed out with a ReceiptPrinter. The
taxes get calculated when an item is added to the cart.

MainIntegrationTest covers the 3 examples given in the description.

The problem description is a bit inconsistent in that there are two
cases where the input name of a product doesn't match the name in the
expected output. I solved this by hard-coding the name-product
mappings in salestax.input.ProductDefinitions. In a real project I'd
prefer to ask for clarification on in and output formats.
